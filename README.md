# Chip Maestro: The Premier SaaS Platform for Poker Club Management

npm install
## Built with Firebase Studio

This entire application was developed in collaboration with **Firebase Studio**, an AI-powered coding partner. Hereâ€™s how it helped bring Chip Maestro to life:

- **Conversational Development**: Instead of writing every line of code from scratch, features were built by describing them in plain English. Firebase Studio translated those ideas into clean, production-ready Next.js and React code.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Complex features like the secure buy-in workflows, real-time Firestore synchronization, and AI-driven anomaly detection were implemented in a fraction of the time it would take traditionally.
- **Iterative Refinement**: We could instantly adjust the UI, change component behavior, and fix bugs through simple conversation, making the development process fluid and highly efficient.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Firebase Studio expertly utilized a modern tech stack, incorporating ShadCN for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Genkit for integrating generative AI features, ensuring the app is both beautiful and powerful.

Chip Maestro is a testament to how conversational AI is changing the way we build software, making it possible for anyone to turn a great idea into a fully functional application.
