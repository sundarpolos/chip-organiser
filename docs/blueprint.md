## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) for a professional yet inviting feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight key interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean and modern look.
- Use a set of simple and modern icons to represent actions and game elements, in a filled style. Icon color should generally be the accent color, and the icons should be large enough to be legible, but not distracting.
- Use a responsive layout to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.  Employ a tab-based interface for player input, to keep different player entries well separated.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations when switching between player tabs, adding buy-ins, and displaying calculation results.  Keep animations short and non-distracting.
